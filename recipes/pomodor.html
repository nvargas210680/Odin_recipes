     <h3>The combination of sweet tomatoes in extra virgin olive oil...</h3>
     <p>"...A well-executed spaghetti al pomodoro is the apotheosis of the fruit, the purest distillation of summer umami." Eric Kim, NYTimes.com</p>

     <h4>Ingredients</h4>

     <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 lbs ripe cocktail tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Kosher salt (and 1 tbsp for pasta water)</li>
        <li>450g thin spaghetti</li>

         <p>Option: 1 tbsp Garlic olive oil for cooking</p>         
        
        <p>Tip: If tomatoes are not completely ripe, add one tsp sugar when cooking</p>    
     </ul>
        

     <h4>Instructions</h4>

     <ol>
        <li>On medium-high place olive oil(s) in large pot or Dutch oven. Heat until shimmering. Add tomatoes and cook until they begin to shed liquid and the sauce bubbles
        <li>Add salt and stir. Lower heat to medium and simmer until reduced about 40 minutes. Stir occasionally.</li>    
        <li>Remove from heat. Place sieve over medium-sized mixing bowl. Pour sauce through sieve, pushing the mixture through with a rubber spatula.</li>
        <li>Press until all the liquid has passed through the sieve and all that is left are seeds and skins.</li>
        <li>Remove pulp from bottom of sieve, too. Return the strained sauce to Dutch oven, adding additional seasoning as necessary.</li>
        <li>Prepare spaghetti according to package directions, cooking to al dente texture.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta completely. Place in Dutch oven, turn heat to high and stir constantly with wooden spoon until for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>The spaghetti should be well coated. Remove pot from heat and let rest for a few minutes. Stir again before serving. You can garnish with cheese, basil leaves, black pepper or a drizzle of Garlic olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
